Dear Dr. Jeffery, 

Sorry that I missed today's class, I thought today's class was cancelled or something. I will go to Thursday's 2:30-3:30pm your office hour to discuss about this class and today's missed class contents, or I will try to schedule a time to meet you if I am not allowed to occupy your other class' office hour time. 

And one more thing I want to mention is that, I don't think it is an appropriate way/manner to put our performance online, even we have only two classmates. I know most of the instructors won't share student's grades with other classmates, and I don't remember I have any instructor who have ever put student's performance online. So I am wondering if you really think this is reasonable or just put there by mistake. 

I look forward to hearing from you. 

Sincerely,
-heyan
