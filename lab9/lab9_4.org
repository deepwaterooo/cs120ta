* Quiz for Week 8 *Answers* 
  (5 pt) Answer the following questions based on the following class declaration:
  #+begin_src
class circle {
  public:
    void print();
  private:
    int x;
    int y;
    float radius;
};
  #+end_src

- Write the code for a default constructor of the class circle that sets the location (x,y) to 0,0 and the radius to 1.
  #+begin_src
circle::circle() {
    x = 0;
    y = 0;
    radius = 1.0;
}
  #+end_src

* Quiz for Week 8 *Answers* (continued)

  #+begin_src
class circle {
  public:
    void print();
  private:
    int x;
    int y;
    float radius;
};
  #+end_src
- Write the code for the print() function so that circles are printed as: 

  *A circle at x,y has radius r* 

  Where x, y, and r are the values for the circle object.

  #+begin_src
void circle::print() {
    cout << "A circle at " << x << ", " << y
         << " has radius " << radius << endl;
}
  #+end_src

* Quiz for Week 8 *Answers* (continued)

  #+begin_src
class circle {
  public:
    void print();
  private:
    int x;
    int y;
    float radius;
};
  #+end_src
- Write the statement(s) to create an array of 100 circles.

    *circle whatEverArrayNameHere[ 100 ];*
- Write the statement(s) to print the 3rd object in the array of question 3.

    *whatEverArrayNameHere[ 2 ].print();*
- Write the statement(s) to print the last object in the array of question 3.

    *whatEverArrayNameHere[ 99 ].print();*

- *Lab 8*:
  - Just got the grading criteria yesterday afternoon after after 4:00pm
  - Will hand it back to you during coming lab
* Emacs
- The reason why I like Emacs:
  - Emacs is an *operating system*;
  - Just like iphone/ipad changed human being's life, emacs *makes programmer's life so much easier~!*
  - Most popular packages: 
    - *autocomplete*
    - *yasnippet*
    - *org-mode*
    - autopair
    - AUCTex
- Personal Experience:
  - when I took CS120 we don't have labs at all, and I have never been exposed to *emacs* or *vim* command based editors;
  - From my experience, I hope you guys can be exposed to these command-based editors *as soon as possible*. 
- Contents that will be covered in this lab:
  - *basic commands* that emacs programmers use every day; 
  - one line *configuration* for line number

* Emacs Basic Commands
- google "*Emacs cheat sheet*"
- Motion

* Emacs configure *Line Number*
- command option
  - works for current buffer
  - commands: *M-x linum-mode RET*
- permanent configuration in home directory
  - go to home directory: *pwd* ----> */home/huan3416*
  - *man ls*, check *-a*, *-l*, *-t* options; type *q* to quit from *man* results
  - *ls -a*: check if there is an emacs configuration file named *.emacs*
  - If not, create *.emacs* file by typing *emacs .emacs* in terminal
  - type *(global-linum-mode 1)* in the file
  - *C-x C-s* to *save* the file
  - *C-x C-c* to *exit* from emacs
- later on when you have questions, please try to use *emacs*, or if you prefer to use *vim*

* Lab 9 Specific Requirements
- *cscheckin*:
