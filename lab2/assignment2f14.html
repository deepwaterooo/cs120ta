<h3> CS120 <br> 
Assignment #2<br>
</h3>
</center>
<p>
Due at midnight on Monday Sept. 15th

</p><p>
Beginning with the Fortune Teller program make the 
additions and modifications:
</p><ul>

<li> Change the program so that the user can enter their first and 
last names as two separate strings.</li> 

<li> Change the program so that it refers to the user by thier first name.  
For example, "Terry, your lucky number is ..."  and "Terry, you should
avoid technology today." </li>

<li> Change the program so that it uses the length of the user's first name and 
the length of their last name as additional values when calculating the user's 
lucky number.
</li>

<li> Change the conditionals used to print the user's "fortune" so that there
are different fortunes for every two lucky numbers.  For example, lucky numbers
0 and 1 give one fortune, 2 and 3 given another fortune, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>


<p>If you can't get all of the modifications done (and for some of the 
assignments you probably won't)
be sure to list which ones you've completed in the comments at the 
beginning of the program.  On the other hand if you did extra work on a
lab or assignment (and sometime you will want to) also describe the extra work in
the comment at the 
beginning of the program.</p>
<p></p>

<p>
Include a block of comments at the beginning of the program 
(or add to the existing block) that lists your name, section number, date,
and the assignment number.  Also include comments on any parts of the
assignment you didn't finish or on any extra work you did.
Include this comment block at the beginning 
of <b>every</b> assignment and lab.
</p>

<p>
For now we are going to assume that the user enters the right type of 
data (e.g. a number when a number is expected and a name when a name is expected).  Later we will start to 
look at correcting user input errors - a big topic.  
</p>


<p>
<b>Turn in:</b> Turn in the code for your program (the .cpp file, not a.out) using the
cscheckin command.
